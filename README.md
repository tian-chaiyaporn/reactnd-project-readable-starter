# Readable API Server

This is the completed project for the final assessment project for Udacity's Redux course. Users are able to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users are be able to edit and delete posts and comments.

This repository includes the code for the backend API Server developed by Udacity's Team.
The code in the frontend folder are developed by myself.
